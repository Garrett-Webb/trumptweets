we are not even into february and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18959495168. cost friday was $603331392. there are at least 25772342 illegal aliens not the 11000000 that have been reported for years in our country. so ridiculous! dhs a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration. democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. cant let that happen! on june 10th the united states will impose a 5% tariff on all goods coming into our country from mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop. the tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.. every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blame the democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws! remember the midterms! so unfair to those who come in legally. due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only.... it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws. in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved. but the dems dont care about the crime they dont want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa! the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration! democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws. ....stem the tide of migration through mexico and to our southern border. this is being done to greatly reduce or eliminate illegal immigration coming from mexico and into the united states. details of the agreement will be released shortly by the state department. thank you! next week ice will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the united states. they will be removed as fast as they come in. mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people....... for those who want and advocate for illegal immigration just take a good look at what has happened to europe over the last 5 years. a total mess! they only wish they had that decision to make over again. could somebody please explain to the democrats (we need their votes) that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow. top border security including a wall is $25 billion. pays for itself in two months. get it done! we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. hard to believe there was a congress and president who would approve! so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed  linebacker edwin jackson. this is just one of many such preventable tragedies. we must get the dems to get tough on the border and with illegal immigration fast! the democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration and ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc. we must protect our country at all cost! i would be willing to shut down government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall! must get rid of lottery catch and release etc. and finally go to system of immigration based on merit! we need great people coming into our country! mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the u.s. they laugh at our dumb immigration laws. they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta. need wall! please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. congress must act on fixing the dumbest and worst immigration laws anywhere in the world! vote r we dont want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us! paul ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about! our new republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border! mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa. our detention areas are maxed out and we will take no more illegals. next step is to close the border! this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico! the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration. our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the dems will do anything not to change them and to obstruct-want open borders which means crime! if the democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. look at the needless  pain and suffering that they are causing. look at the horrors taking place on the border. chuck and nancy call me! jobs are returning illegal immigration is plummeting law order and justice are being restored. we are truly making america great again! if the democrats dont give us the votes to change our weak ineffective and dangerous immigration laws we must fight hard for these votes in the 2020 election! 'immigration ban is one of trump most popular orders so far'  ....our immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to make america great again! thank you to the great republican senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. we must build the wall stop illegal immigration end chain migration and cancel the visa lottery. the current system is unsafe and unfair to the great people of our country - time for change! under our horrible immigration laws the government is frequently blocked from deporting criminal aliens with violent felony convictions. house gop just passed a bill to increase our ability to deport violent felons (crazy dems opposed). need to get this bill to my desk fast! elect more republicans in  november and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world. right now we have the dumbest and the worst. dems are doing nothing but obstructing. remember their motto resist! ours is produce! the democrats in congress are getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing! sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go fishing. the american people are tired of the never ending witch hunt they want results now! we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country. when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came. our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order. most children come without parents... democrats must change the immigration laws fast. if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants - and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. change the laws now! we must have border security get rid of chain lottery catch and release sanctuary cities - go to merit based immigration. protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall! any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. they cant. if we had a wall they wouldnt even try! the two..... we have a national emergency at our southern border. the dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. would immediately solve the problem! mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the world refuses to help with illegal immigration and drugs! illegal immigration affects the lives of all americans. illegal immigration hurts american workers burdens american taxpayers undermines public safety and places enormous strain on local schools hospitals and communities... i would like to thank the president of mexico andres manuel lopez obrador and his foreign minister marcelo ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the united states and mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed! we are gathered today to hear directly from the american victims of illegal immigration. these are the american citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens. these are the families the media ignores... ....through their country and our southern border. mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the u.s. far greater than border costs. if mexico doesnt immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing..... the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall end catch and release visa lottery and chain and go to merit based immigration. go for it! win! heading to beautiful west virginia to be with great members of the republican party. will be planning infrastructure and discussing immigration and daca not easy when we have no support from the democrats. not one dem voted for our tax cut bill! need more republicans in 18. ....the fact is when i took over as president our country was a mess. depleted military endless wars a potential war with north korea v.a. high taxes and too many regulations border immigration and healthcare problems and much more. i had no choice but to work very long hours! this is my 500th. day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days. massive tax and regulation cuts military and vets lower crime and illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy and jobs ever and much more... we shouldnt be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the wall hire border agents and ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password. another fake story on  that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. of course this is not true. mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day! the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country. homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long! democrats in congress must return from their vacations and change the immigration laws or the border despite the great job being done by border patrol will only get worse. big sections of wall now being built! the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world. mexico has the strongest and they make more than $100 billion a year on the u.s. therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now and mexico must stop illegals from entering the u.s.... why dont the democrats give us the votes to fix the worlds worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms-13 coming into our country illegally? our border patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses. the democrats bad immigration laws which could be easily fixed are the problem. great job by border patrol above and beyond. many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they..... democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration border wall military pro life v.a. judges 2nd amendment and more. no to jones a pelosi/schumer puppet! congress - fix our insane immigration laws now! daca has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that cryin chuck schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration! i dont care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown... the caravans are a disgrace to the democrat party. change the immigration laws now! we are fighting hard for merit based immigration no more democrat lottery systems. we must get much tougher (and smarter).   government funding bill past last night in the house of representatives. now democrats are needed if it is to pass in the senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. shutdown coming? we need more republican victories in 2018! such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours. actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama. fake news is working overtime! we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system.  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security.  brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia. the primary is on tuesday. brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment. i give him my full and total endorsement. ...at every turn in attempts to gain access. but now republicans and democrats must come together for the good of the american people. no more costly and time consuming investigations. lets do immigration (border) infrastructure much lower drug prices and much more - and do it now! mexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through mexico and into the u.s. we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement. our country cannot accept what is happening! also we must get wall funding fast. at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process (deportation) for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border. if not deportations start! bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed. a great job done by all! now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum. thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration - a very big difference! illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year. how was this allowed to happen? we are going to demand congress secure the border in the upcoming cr. illegal immigration must end! the united states has been spending billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration. this will not continue. democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. if not we will be forced to play a much tougher hand. as ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from. a whole big wasted procedure must take place. mexico and canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an obama joke. act congress can you imagine cryin chuck schumer saying out loud for all to hear that i am bluffing with respect to putting tariffs on mexico. what a creep. he would rather have our country fail with drugs and immigration than give republicans a win. but he gave mexico bad advice no bluff! ....countries which are doing badly. i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. i want safety and security for our people. i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. i want to fund our military not do a dem defund.... the migrant caravan that is openly defying our border shows how weak and ineffective u.s. immigration laws are. yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda  tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities. we need lawmakers who will put america first. republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november. dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. we can pass great legislation after the red wave! i am very disappointed that mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our southern border where everyone knows that because of the democrats our immigration laws are totally flawed and broken... i look forward to working w/ d + r in congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st. time to end the visa lottery. congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans.  the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security. the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever. we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! no more dangerous lottery. after north korea missile launch it more important than ever to fund our gov't and military! dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty and illegal immigration. i ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. they can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands. our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the united states. we will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.  polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca fully secures the border ends chain migration and cancels the visa lottery. if ds oppose this deal they arent serious about daca-they just want open borders.  you cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including heart without getting dem votes. problem is they dont care about security and rs do. zero dems voted to support the goodlatte bill. they wont vote for anything! it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime. tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration. change the laws! its the democrats fault they wont give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. they want open borders which breeds horrible crime. republicans want security. but i am working on something - it never ends! ap-norc poll: immigration among the top concerns in 2019. people want to stop drugs and criminals at the border. want border security! tell the dems to do the inevitable now rather than later. the wait is costly and dangerous! 80% of mexicos exports come to the united states. they totally rely on us which is fine with me. they do have though very strong immigration laws. the u.s. has pathetically weak and ineffective immigration laws that the democrats refuse to help us fix. will speak to mexico! congress should come back to d.c. now and fix the immigration laws! no amnesty is not a part of my offer. it is a 3 year extension of daca. amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11000000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful nancy! ....what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country - see how that works for controlling immigration! they talk about israel like theyre a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region. they wanted... these flyers depict australias policy on illegal immigration. much can be learned!  democrats in congress must no longer obstruct - vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now. i am watching what is going on from europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. they are just using children! immigration discussions at the white house with representatives of mexico have ended for the day. progress is being made but not nearly enough! border arrests for may are at 133000 because of mexico and the democrats in congress refusing to budge on immigration reform. further... when we have an infestation of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ice! they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems do not appreciate the great job they do! nov. the problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the democrats don't want secure bordersthey don't care about safety for u.s.a. ....in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws. once that happens all will be smooth. we can never allow open borders! mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades. because of the dems our immigration laws are bad. mexico makes a fortune from the u.s. have for decades they can easily fix this problem. time for them to finally do what must be done! house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill known as goodlatte ii in their afternoon vote today even though the dems wont let it pass in the senate. passage will show that we want strong borders and security while the dems want open borders = crime.  win! florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state and forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. bill prohibits local govt from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants... congressman matt gaetz of florida is one of the finest and most talented people in congress. strong on crime the border illegal immigration the 2nd amendment our great military and vets matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our massive tax cuts. he has my full endorsement! the people of alabama will do the right thing. doug jones is pro-abortion weak on crime military and illegal immigration bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall. jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet. roy moore will always vote with us. vote roy moore! ....if this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in its tracks - and at very little by comparison cost. this is the only real answer - and we must continue to build the wall! we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the u.s. has been asking about getting for many years. it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexicos legislative body!.. the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border. because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low. stop drugs! we are here on this beautiful spring day to unveil our plan to create a fair modern and lawful system of immigration for the u.s. if adopted our plan will transform americas immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world.  i am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong fair and sound immigration policy that mark morgan will be joining the trump administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ice. mark is a true believer and american patriot. he will do a great job! while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa! what is the purpose of the house doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by democrats in the senate and the dems are only looking to obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the mid-terms). republicans must get rid of the stupid filibuster rule-it is killing you! honduras mexico and many other countries that the u.s. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies. caravans are heading here. must pass tough laws and build the wall. democrats allow open borders drugs and crime! even if we get 100% republican votes in the senate we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill - and the dems are obstructionists who wont give votes for political reasons and because they dont care about crime coming from border! so we need to elect more rs! ....its powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the u.s. and removing them back to their country of origin. until mexico cleans up this ridiculous and massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry.... according to the center for immigration studies the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole...  the new york times sanctuary cities/immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. they never call to check for truth. their sources often dont even exist a fraud. they will lie and cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. in 6 years they will be gone........ the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration. so easy to solve!    now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security. congress must pass smart fast and reasonable immigration laws now. law enforcement at the border is doing a great job but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. when people with or without children enter our country they must be told to leave without our........ our southern border is under siege. congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. must build a wall. mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!
